## 📖 About embedding-inversion-demo

embedding-inversion-demo is a tool that helps you recover original text from embedding vectors. Embeddings are numeric codes that represent text in a way a computer can understand. This tool uses a method called conditional masked diffusion along with parallel denoising to make accurate reconstructions.  

This project provides:
- A live demo where you can see the recovery in action
- A training pipeline for advanced users interested in customizing the model
- A detailed technical report explaining its methods and results 

The focus is on showing how text can be retrieved from embeddings, which is useful for understanding privacy and security in language models.

## 💡 Who This Is For

You do not need programming skills to use this software. It is suitable for:
- Anyone curious about text embeddings and their reversibility
- Students studying natural language processing (NLP)
- Researchers exploring privacy risks in AI models
- Security professionals testing embedding-related vulnerabilities

You just need a computer with internet access to download the software and try it out.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

Before downloading, make sure your system meets these minimum needs:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.14 or later, or a recent Linux distribution
- **Processor:** Intel i5 / AMD Ryzen 5 or better
- **Memory:** At least 8 GB of RAM
- **Storage:** Minimum 1 GB of free disk space
- **Internet Connection:** Required for download and for using the live demo
- **Graphics:** Dedicated GPU not required but helpful for faster processing

No special software is needed before running the program. Everything necessary is included in the download.

## 🎛️ Using embedding-inversion-demo

The app offers two main features:

### 1. Live Demo  
Try recovering text from example embedding vectors. The demo shows the results in real time and lets you tweak some settings for accuracy.

### 2. Training Pipeline  
Advanced users can retrain the model with custom data. This section provides options to load data, set training parameters, and monitor progress.

### Basic Workflow for Live Demo

- Launch the demo mode.
- Select or input the embedding vector you want to invert.
- Click “Start” to run the recovery process.
- View the recovered text on the screen.
- Adjust parameters such as denoising steps to improve output quality.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you experience issues, try these common fixes:

- **App Won’t Launch:** Make sure your operating system is updated. Restart your computer and try again.
- **Download Issues:** Use a stable internet connection. Clear browser cache and retry download.
- **Slow Performance:** Close other programs. If possible, use a computer with more RAM or a faster CPU.
- **Errors in Recovery:** Check that you entered valid embeddings. Restart the app and reload data.
